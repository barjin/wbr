## Web Browser Robot

Forget everything you know about tedious asynchronous programming in Playwright or Puppeteer and focus on what you really want to achieve instead. Using an intuitive **if-this-then-that** schema, optimized concurrency with zero run conditions, and state-of-art backend technology, creating crawlers and automations has never been easier.

## Installation
```bash
npm i -S @wbr-project/wbr-interpret
```

This installs the package into the `node_modules` folder of your project. The package also includes [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) typings by default to facilitate its usage.

Now you are all set!

## Made for people, tailored to devs

With WBR, even a complete beginner can start scraping and crawling in no time. See the [docs](./docs/) and read for yourself how you can create your first scraper/crawler/automation with WBR.

Are you *way too senior* for this child's play? We've got you covered. WBR allows you to embed your own high-performance code into its syntax, effectively combining the generic easy-to-maintain nature of Smart Workflows and specific niche actions crucial for your use case. From the outside, the programmed user actions are indistinguishable from native WBR's actions. 

## Example

Creating _lightning-fast web automations_ with WBR is easier than you think - nobody likes to [spend 8 hours writing an automation to a 1-hour task](https://xkcd.com/1319/). Consider the following snippet:

```javascript
[{
    where: {
        url: "https://wikipedia.org"
    },
    what: [
        {
            action: "scrape",
        }
    ]
}]
```

This code snippet is a 100% valid WBR workflow definition. What does it do? **It scrapes `https://wikipedia.org`**. Yes, yes, not very impressive, I know. 

In that case, take a look at this one:

```javascript
[{
    where: {
        selectors: [
            "form input[type=text]",
            "form input[type=password]",
        ]
    },
    what: [
        {
            action: "fill",
            args: [
                "form input"
                "login@login.com"
            ]
        },
        {
            action: "fill",
            args: [
                "form input[type=password]"
                "verysecretpassword"
            ]
        },
        {
            action: "keyboard.press",
            args: "Enter"
        }
    ]
}]
```

What does this one do? On a page (any page) with a login form, this Smart Workflow fills in the login form and hits `Enter`, effectively logging the user in. This demonstrates many strengths of the Smart Workflow philosophy - they are highly reusable, as generic as possible, and help you automating your use cases while writing less code, only describing what you really want to do.
