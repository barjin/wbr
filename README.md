## Watch out! 🛑

As of today (12.11.2021), this project will most certainly **not fit your web automation needs.** 
As long as you are seeing this message here, it is under heavy development, and there is no (safe) real-world use case for it. 👷🏽‍♂️🏗
In case you kept reading until now and want to help us with the development, we'll be stoked :).
