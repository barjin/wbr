## Web Browser Robot

Forget everything you know about tedious asynchronous programming in Playwright or Puppeteer and focus on what you really want to achieve instead. Using an intuitive **if-this-then-that** schema, optimized concurrency with zero run conditions and state-of-art backend technology, creating crawlers and automations has never been easier.

## How easy it is?
Creating _lightning fast web automations_ with WBR is easier than you think. Consider the following snippet:
```javascript
[{
    where: {
        url: "https://wikipedia.org"
    },
    what: [
        {
            type: "scrape",
        }
    ]
}]
```
This code snippet is a 100% valid WBR workflow definition. What does it do? **It scrapes `https://wikipedia.org`**.

You see that with WBR, even a complete beginner can start scraping and crawling in no time. Still not sure? See the [docs](./docs/) and read for yourself, how you can create your first scraper/crawler/automation with WBR.
