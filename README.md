## Watch out! 🛑

As of today (03.12.2021), this project will most certainly **not fit your web automation needs.** 
- So far, only the *interpreter* is implemented, and the workflows (the robot source code) need to be written 
manually (there is no way of recording them).
\
Other parts of the project (namely the recorder itself) are under heavy development 👷🏽‍♂️👨🏽‍🏭🏗
\
In case you kept reading until now and want to help us with the development, we would be stoked :).
